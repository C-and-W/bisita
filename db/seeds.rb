Church.create(name: 'Betis Church', location: 'Pampanga', longitude: 14.590, latitude: 120.380, year: 1770, architecture: 'Baroque', make: 'Concrete', region: 'III', distance: 77, bg_title1: 'Dubbed as the', bg_title2: '"Sistine Chapel of the Philippines"', background: 'Built in a town well-known for carving or dukit as natives would call it and for trade even before the Spanish colonisation. The town of Betis, Guagua in Pampanga is around an hour and a half away by car from Manila, is home to this Betis Church which may be one of the most valuable churches in terms of art and design. The carvers from Betis are well-known to be master-carvers of European design furniture and church murals. The church is dedicated to St. James, the Apostle as is part of the Philippines’ National Cultural Treasure as declared by the National Museum and the NCAA. The initial construction of the Betis Church was done in 1660 under the supervision of Father José de la Cruz, and it was done with the composition of wood and stucco - which made it vulnerable to various fires. The church would finally be reconstructed with the use of concrete materials in 1770 and this would mark the beginning of the art-driven journey of this church. The church’s artworks are done by Macario Ligon and his nephew the well-known Victor Ramos who thrived with ecclesiastical paintings. Experts and historians are still figuring out whether the renowned painter Simon Flores had several of his works in the church; or just an apprentice who had similar style to the master - whether it’s Simon Flores or not, these paintings are presented in a very detailed way, proving that only an expert of his craft could have been the artist. Outside, the church may look plain and simple, but what it possesses inside will quickly shift anyone’s perspective as it overwhelms all senses with its intricate and detailed finishings - leaving a sense of awe and amazement. Just by standing at the church’s nave, one can see the well-decorated ceilings, walls and retablo. In addition to the well-preserved interiors, the thick hardwood flooring of the Betis Church is something you rarely see with the different historical churches in the country - proving how the same amount of appreciation and care the people of Betis have for this church throughout generations. Today, the Betis Church still stands as one of the grandest and dubbed as the “Sistine Chapel of the Philippines” - it has become a popular place to visit for art, architectural and design students alike as it provides morethan just historical value but an overwhelming amount of local artwork and craft. Images and words can never truly and fully showcase the beauty of experiencing the grand Betis Church in person.', fact_title: 'Victor Ramos', artistic_value: 16)

Church.create(name: 'Calasiao Church (Saints Peter and Paul Parish Church)', location: 'Pangasinan', longitude: 16.02, latitude: 120.380, year: 1753, year_note: 'Original church was built in stages from the 17th to 19th centuries but damaged by earthquakes and fires', architecture: 'Baroque', make: 'Adobe stone, bricks and concrete', region: 'I', distance: 207, bg_title1: '', bg_title2: '', background: 'Situated at the heart of Calasiao, Pangasinan, the Saints Peter and Paul Parish Church is one of the most well-preserved churches in the country despite being one of the oldest and also tested throughout time. The municipality of Calasiao is known throughout the country for their very delicious rice cakes the Puto Calasiao. The church has gone through a number of damages throughout its time - whether it be by natural disasters or by the war, and despite these obstacles, the Calasiao Church remained as the richest in ornaments in the entire province. The church was also home to the Archbishop during the American era which was quite fitting, having such a high-profile person situated in a church well-kept and taken cared of. The convent and church are made of bricks and the 3-naved church has dimensions of 84 meters long and 25.5 meters wide making it one of the biggest churches in the province, while the five-story hexgonal bell tower which stands at 30 meters high, and is considered as one of the best in Pangasinan. The bell tower’s exteriors are quite unique as each story appears to be smaller than the previous one. The church’s exteriors are crafted with bricks and despite being rebuilt numerous of times, you can still peek through to see the original construction material from its time-torn facade. The colors of brick and concrete make the exterior of the Calasiao Church look as historical as it already is - you can only imagine the events and happenings it has gone through and experienced. The architectural style stays true to the Philippines’ classic Baroque; the quadrangle at the front of the church is surrounded by a posts with select saints on each one. The pediment of the church features a semicircular niche accompanied by a winged cherub and holds statues of Saints Peter and Paul. The church’s retablo holds up the Saints Peter & Paul, together with seven other icons, having it filled up to leave a grand and formidable centerpiece - it’s important to take note that this altar is the original retablo as it was left untouched by the latest earthquake. The pendentives holds up the words “Tues Petrus”, “Et Super Hanc Petram” and “Aedificabo Ecclesiam Mean” which mean “You are Peter, and on this rock I will built My church.” The church’s ceiling is painted in White with Light Blue accents, matched with gold ornaments scattered in pattern throughout the nave up until the cupola and retablo. The Calasiao Church was declared a National Culture Treasure by the National Museum and NCAA in 2001, and today, still stands a quiet church with its utterly simple elegance but still imposes itself with the architectural style and design, together with the composition.', artistic_value: 8)
