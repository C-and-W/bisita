Church.create(name: 'Betis Church', location: 'Pampanga', longitude: 120.380, latitude: 14.590, year: 1770, architecture: 'Baroque', make: 'Concrete', region: 'III', distance: 77, bg_title1: 'Dubbed as the', bg_title2: '"Sistine Chapel of the Philippines"', background: 'Built in a town well-known for carving or dukit as natives would call it and for trade even before the Spanish colonisation. The town of Betis, Guagua in Pampanga is around an hour and a half away by car from Manila, is home to this Betis Church which may be one of the most valuable churches in terms of art and design. The carvers from Betis are well-known to be master-carvers of European design furniture and church murals. The church is dedicated to St. James, the Apostle as is part of the Philippines’ National Cultural Treasure as declared by the National Museum and the NCAA. The initial construction of the Betis Church was done in 1660 under the supervision of Father José de la Cruz, and it was done with the composition of wood and stucco - which made it vulnerable to various fires. The church would finally be reconstructed with the use of concrete materials in 1770 and this would mark the beginning of the art-driven journey of this church. The church’s artworks are done by Macario Ligon and his nephew the well-known Victor Ramos who thrived with ecclesiastical paintings. Experts and historians are still figuring out whether the renowned painter Simon Flores had several of his works in the church; or just an apprentice who had similar style to the master - whether it’s Simon Flores or not, these paintings are presented in a very detailed way, proving that only an expert of his craft could have been the artist. Outside, the church may look plain and simple, but what it possesses inside will quickly shift anyone’s perspective as it overwhelms all senses with its intricate and detailed finishings - leaving a sense of awe and amazement. Just by standing at the church’s nave, one can see the well-decorated ceilings, walls and retablo. In addition to the well-preserved interiors, the thick hardwood flooring of the Betis Church is something you rarely see with the different historical churches in the country - proving how the same amount of appreciation and care the people of Betis have for this church throughout generations. Today, the Betis Church still stands as one of the grandest and dubbed as the “Sistine Chapel of the Philippines” - it has become a popular place to visit for art, architectural and design students alike as it provides morethan just historical value but an overwhelming amount of local artwork and craft. Images and words can never truly and fully showcase the beauty of experiencing the grand Betis Church in person.', fact_title: 'Victor Ramos', artistic_value: 16)

Church.create(name: 'Calasiao Church (Saints Peter and Paul Parish Church)', location: 'Pangasinan', longitude: 120.2125, latitude: 16.03611111111111, year: 1753, year_note: 'Original church was built in stages from the 17th to 19th centuries but damaged by earthquakes and fires', architecture: 'Baroque', make: 'Adobe stone, bricks and concrete', region: 'I', distance: 207, bg_title1: '', bg_title2: '', background: 'Situated at the heart of Calasiao, Pangasinan, the Saints Peter and Paul Parish Church is one of the most well-preserved churches in the country despite being one of the oldest and also tested throughout time. The municipality of Calasiao is known throughout the country for their very delicious rice cakes the Puto Calasiao. The church has gone through a number of damages throughout its time - whether it be by natural disasters or by the war, and despite these obstacles, the Calasiao Church remained as the richest in ornaments in the entire province. The church was also home to the Archbishop during the American era which was quite fitting, having such a high-profile person situated in a church well-kept and taken cared of. The convent and church are made of bricks and the 3-naved church has dimensions of 84 meters long and 25.5 meters wide making it one of the biggest churches in the province, while the five-story hexgonal bell tower which stands at 30 meters high, and is considered as one of the best in Pangasinan. The bell tower’s exteriors are quite unique as each story appears to be smaller than the previous one. The church’s exteriors are crafted with bricks and despite being rebuilt numerous of times, you can still peek through to see the original construction material from its time-torn facade. The colors of brick and concrete make the exterior of the Calasiao Church look as historical as it already is - you can only imagine the events and happenings it has gone through and experienced. The architectural style stays true to the Philippines’ classic Baroque; the quadrangle at the front of the church is surrounded by a posts with select saints on each one. The pediment of the church features a semicircular niche accompanied by a winged cherub and holds statues of Saints Peter and Paul. The church’s retablo holds up the Saints Peter & Paul, together with seven other icons, having it filled up to leave a grand and formidable centerpiece - it’s important to take note that this altar is the original retablo as it was left untouched by the latest earthquake. The pendentives holds up the words “Tues Petrus”, “Et Super Hanc Petram” and “Aedificabo Ecclesiam Mean” which mean “You are Peter, and on this rock I will built My church.” The church’s ceiling is painted in White with Light Blue accents, matched with gold ornaments scattered in pattern throughout the nave up until the cupola and retablo. The Calasiao Church was declared a National Culture Treasure by the National Museum and NCAA in 2001, and today, still stands a quiet church with its utterly simple elegance but still imposes itself with the architectural style and design, together with the composition.', artistic_value: 8)

Church.create(name: 'Majayjay Church (Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church)', location: 'Laguna', longitude: 121.47222222222223, latitude: 14.144444444444444, year: 1649, architecture: 'Romanesque', make: 'Adobe stone, lumber, bricks and galvanized iron', region: 'IV-A', distance: 120, bg_title1: '', bg_title2: '', background: 'The Majayjay Church is found atop the mountainous terrain of Laguna, this Romanesque structure gives a commanding and towering view of Laguna Bay and served as a site of early Catholicism in the province. The church has also had its fair challenges in being built, it was rebuilt four times during its time up until today, though constant efforts of preservation is being done. The church was rebuilt with stone the first three times, and on the final time, adobe stone with red tiles and prime lumber were all used. Later on, the roof would be changed to galvanised iron due to damage by typhoons. During its completion in 1730, the Majayjay Church became the biggest in the entire country, with its current dimensions of 200 meters in length, 17 meters in width, and 16.5 meters in height - matched with thick and powerful buttresses which solidifies the foundation of the church. The thick walls of the Majayjay Church are 3-meters thick, and was a result of constant rebuilding. The church’s red walls act as a vivid facade to the massive structure it already is; it features a three-level facade with each level scaled proportionately, leaving a lasting feeling of symmetry. Each level of the facade have their own retablos holding statues of select saints - this facade displays the great mix and infusion of the overall Romanesque architecture and subtle Baroque accents with the circular spaces, protuberant columns and the matching arched windows of the belfry which is topped off by a very Romanesque-styled spire. The five-story belfry further enhances the symmetry this church possesses with it being situated a bit recessed from the church. It also brings out the contrasting colors of the red bricked facade of the church and the dark stoned finish of the belfry. The church’s colors come to live even more with the mix of moss and vines covering the red bricks and adobe stone finish. The interior of the church is even as impressive, with a gold and red detailing theme leaves a dramatic effect for both locals and visitors. The 60-meter long nave is accompanied by cantilever balconies on both sides leading to the church’s massive cupola. Upon entering, one cannot miss three grand altars all done in Red and accented by Gold, including the retablo mayor - the retablos of the altar feature antique statues of saints. Aside from the three retablos up front, there are two minor retablos with intricate designs. The retablo mayor is accompanied by a painting above it depicting the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Contrasting the grand altars, the azulejo-tiled floor simply blends right in together with the brick-walled nave. The church has been part of the rehabilitation program of the National Conservation Society of the Philippines since 1954 and is also declared as a National Cultural Treasure in 2001.', fact_title: '', artistic_value: 8)

Church.create(name: 'Minalin Church (Santa Monica Parish Church)', location: 'Pampanga', longitude: 120.6836, latitude: 14.9684, year: 1834, architecture: 'Baroque', make: 'Concrete, bricks and steel', region: 'III', distance: 69, bg_title1: '', bg_title2: '', background: 'The town of Minalin, Pampanga boasts one of the most beautiful churches in the country - showcasing a unique facade resembling the staple of all churches, a giant retablo leaving a striking feeling with its form and adornment. The church has quite the history, with a legend in which lumber stocks for the construction ofthe church which was originally in Barangay Sta. Maria was carried all the way to its present location by floods; the name Minalin comes from the saying, “minalis la ding dutung, minalis ya ing pisamban” (the lumber moved, and so must the church). The unique retable-liked facade of the Minalin Church reveals the original red brick walls, giving the church its old-rose feel and touch from both far and near. The composition of the facade is broken into two levels by a horizontal stringcourse which is supported by Corinthian columns at either end - the perfect mix of Baroque and Corinthian styles make this church a unique one. Its triangular pediment is topped with a latern like campanile which used to hold up a lighted beacon at its apex to guide fishermen by the river. Floral carvings accompany the semicircular arch of the main doorway and the window. The semi-circular niches hold painted stone statues of select Augustinian saints, and are complementary to the rose design of the facade. Another unique feature of the facade is the twin four-storey, low and squat octagonal bell towers which  flank both sides of the church - the spires of the two bell towers also depict a Moorish type of architecture, which hints at the old Islamic faith of the people of Minalin. The confluence of various cultural influences is further showcased by lotus flowers with Buddhist motif carved at one door of the church, while also wooden trusses which are shaped at the edge like a crocodile can be traced back to pre-Hispanic folk beliefs. The overall look of the facade leaves a vertical motion which is accentuated by the flanking of the two bell towers. A rare feature which the Minalin Church is comprised of is that the four capillas posas* in the low stone atrium which encloses the church grounds. It is the only church to still have this element intact which is also a common feature in Latin America . The interiors of the church feature a refurbished ceiling which covers the original composition and is done with wooden panels throughout; the nave walls keep intact the red bricks seen outside the church. The Minalin Church has one of the most beautiful retablos situated behind the altar with its grand White and Gold finish - eleven antique statues are placed in each niche. The statues play complement to the highlight and is of high value which is the 18th-century Our Lady of Consolation painting at the apex of the main altar. Another interesting feature is the bas relief of the Pierced Heart of Sta. Monica which symbolises suffering because of St. Augustine’s life of sin before turning his life around. The Minalin Church was declared a National Cultural Treasure in 2001.', fact_title: '', artistic_value: 12)
