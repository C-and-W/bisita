Church.create(name: 'Betis Church', location: 'Pampanga', longitude: 120.380, latitude: 14.590, year: 1770, architecture: 'Baroque', make: 'Concrete', region: 'III', distance: 77, bg_title1: 'Dubbed as the', bg_title2: '"Sistine Chapel of the Philippines"', background: 'Built in a town well-known for carving or dukit as natives would call it and for trade even before the Spanish colonisation. The town of Betis, Guagua in Pampanga is around an hour and a half away by car from Manila, is home to this Betis Church which may be one of the most valuable churches in terms of art and design. The carvers from Betis are well-known to be master-carvers of European design furniture and church murals. The church is dedicated to St. James, the Apostle as is part of the Philippines’ National Cultural Treasure as declared by the National Museum and the NCAA. The initial construction of the Betis Church was done in 1660 under the supervision of Father José de la Cruz, and it was done with the composition of wood and stucco - which made it vulnerable to various fires. The church would finally be reconstructed with the use of concrete materials in 1770 and this would mark the beginning of the art-driven journey of this church. The church’s artworks are done by Macario Ligon and his nephew the well-known Victor Ramos who thrived with ecclesiastical paintings. Experts and historians are still figuring out whether the renowned painter Simon Flores had several of his works in the church; or just an apprentice who had similar style to the master - whether it’s Simon Flores or not, these paintings are presented in a very detailed way, proving that only an expert of his craft could have been the artist. Outside, the church may look plain and simple, but what it possesses inside will quickly shift anyone’s perspective as it overwhelms all senses with its intricate and detailed finishings - leaving a sense of awe and amazement. Just by standing at the church’s nave, one can see the well-decorated ceilings, walls and retablo. In addition to the well-preserved interiors, the thick hardwood flooring of the Betis Church is something you rarely see with the different historical churches in the country - proving how the same amount of appreciation and care the people of Betis have for this church throughout generations. Today, the Betis Church still stands as one of the grandest and dubbed as the “Sistine Chapel of the Philippines” - it has become a popular place to visit for art, architectural and design students alike as it provides morethan just historical value but an overwhelming amount of local artwork and craft. Images and words can never truly and fully showcase the beauty of experiencing the grand Betis Church in person.', fact_title: 'Victor Ramos', artistic_value: 16, photo_number: 14)

The municipality of Calasiao is known throughout the country for their very delicious rice cakes the Puto Calasiao. The church has gone through a number of damages throughout its time - whether it be by natural disasters or by the war, and despite these obstacles, the Calasiao Church remained as the richest in ornaments in the entire province. The church was also home to the Archbishop during the American era which was quite fitting, having such a high-profile person situated in a church well-kept and taken cared of. The convent and church are made of bricks and the 3-naved church has dimensions of 84 meters long and 25.5 meters wide making it one of the biggest churches in the province, while the five-story hexgonal bell tower which stands at 30 meters high, and is considered as one of the best in Pangasinan. The bell tower’s exteriors are quite unique as each story appears to be smaller than the previous one. The church’s exteriors are crafted with bricks and despite being rebuilt numerous of times, you can still peek through to see the original construction material from its time-torn facade. The colors of brick and concrete make the exterior of the Calasiao Church look as historical as it already is - you can only imagine the events and happenings it has gone through and experienced. The architectural style stays true to the Philippines’ classic Baroque; the quadrangle at the front of the church is surrounded by a posts with select saints on each one. The pediment of the church features a semicircular niche accompanied by a winged cherub and holds statues of Saints Peter and Paul. The church’s retablo holds up the Saints Peter & Paul, together with seven other icons, having it filled up to leave a grand and formidable centerpiece - it’s important to take note that this altar is the original retablo as it was left untouched by the latest earthquake. The pendentives holds up the words “Tues Petrus”, “Et Super Hanc Petram” and “Aedificabo Ecclesiam Mean” which mean “You are Peter, and on this rock I will built My church.” The church’s ceiling is painted in White with Light Blue accents, matched with gold ornaments scattered in pattern throughout the nave up until the cupola and retablo. The Calasiao Church was declared a National Culture Treasure by the National Museum and NCAA in 2001, and today, still stands a quiet church with its utterly simple elegance but still imposes itself with the architectural style and design, together with the composition.', artistic_value: 8, photo_number: 12)

The church has also had its fair challenges in being built, it was rebuilt four times during its time up until today, though constant efforts of preservation is being done. The church was rebuilt with stone the first three times, and on the final time, adobe stone with red tiles and prime lumber were all used. Later on, the roof would be changed to galvanised iron due to damage by typhoons. During its completion in 1730, the Majayjay Church became the biggest in the entire country, with its current dimensions of 200 meters in length, 17 meters in width, and 16.5 meters in height - matched with thick and powerful buttresses which solidifies the foundation of the church. The thick walls of the Majayjay Church are 3-meters thick, and was a result of constant rebuilding. The church’s red walls act as a vivid facade to the massive structure it already is; it features a three-level facade with each level scaled proportionately, leaving a lasting feeling of symmetry. Each level of the facade have their own retablos holding statues of select saints - this facade displays the great mix and infusion of the overall Romanesque architecture and subtle Baroque accents with the circular spaces, protuberant columns and the matching arched windows of the belfry which is topped off by a very Romanesque-styled spire. The five-story belfry further enhances the symmetry this church possesses with it being situated a bit recessed from the church. It also brings out the contrasting colors of the red bricked facade of the church and the dark stoned finish of the belfry. The church’s colors come to live even more with the mix of moss and vines covering the red bricks and adobe stone finish. The interior of the church is even as impressive, with a gold and red detailing theme leaves a dramatic effect for both locals and visitors. The 60-meter long nave is accompanied by cantilever balconies on both sides leading to the church’s massive cupola. Upon entering, one cannot miss three grand altars all done in Red and accented by Gold, including the retablo mayor - the retablos of the altar feature antique statues of saints. Aside from the three retablos up front, there are two minor retablos with intricate designs. The retablo mayor is accompanied by a painting above it depicting the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Contrasting the grand altars, the azulejo-tiled floor simply blends right in together with the brick-walled nave. The church has been part of the rehabilitation program of the National Conservation Society of the Philippines since 1954 and is also declared as a National Cultural Treasure in 2001.', fact_title: '', artistic_value: 8, photo_number: 9)

This church may be the simplest of them all but is definitely a marvel to have it on Philippine soil - it’s quite amazing to think that this church still stands even with the advent of modern times. The church is one of the most difficult to visit in mainland Luzon but seeing that the structure of the church hasn’t been much altered from the time it was built in the 17th century, the trip up is worth every kilometer. Experiencing this church up close takes you to a trip back in time, as if the church has a connection back when the construction was made possible by a local chieftain. The church is one of the few left standing that features rubble stone construction with decorations applied only to the facade - the solid squatness of the ensemble brought out by its high windows and a simply pediment just below it, suggests a fortress-like appearance. It is also unique among Spanish-era churches around the province of the Cagayan Valley because of itssize and novel design. The firm facade is covered with vines and moss due to the test of time, weather and everything that comes in between - exuding an earthly feeling. The three-level bell tower stands on the left, featuring a conical roof and finials protruding out of the corners of each level. The main doorway is flanked by niches for saints, while the upper level features a relief cross serving as ornamentation as the centrepiece of the entire facade. The detailed exterior contrasts the simple interior of the church which greets the entrance with white wood panels supporting the roof, and an altar capped by four retablos with statues of Jesus Christ, Mother Mary, and select saints. Outside the windows along the nave, rubble and ruins of what used to be the convent are seen; though permanently damaged by typhoons, it now transcends a unique feeling of budding curiosity.

The church has quite the history, with a legend in which lumber stocks for the construction ofthe church which was originally in Barangay Sta. Maria was carried all the way to its present location by floods; the name Minalin comes from the saying, “minalis la ding dutung, minalis ya ing pisamban” (the lumber moved, and so must the church). The unique retable-liked facade of the Minalin Church reveals the original red brick walls, giving the church its old-rose feel and touch from both far and near. The composition of the facade is broken into two levels by a horizontal stringcourse which is supported by Corinthian columns at either end - the perfect mix of Baroque and Corinthian styles make this church a unique one. Its triangular pediment is topped with a latern like campanile which used to hold up a lighted beacon at its apex to guide fishermen by the river. Floral carvings accompany the semicircular arch of the main doorway and the window. The semi-circular niches hold painted stone statues of select Augustinian saints, and are complementary to the rose design of the facade. Another unique feature of the facade is the twin four-storey, low and squat octagonal bell towers which  flank both sides of the church - the spires of the two bell towers also depict a Moorish type of architecture, which hints at the old Islamic faith of the people of Minalin. The confluence of various cultural influences is further showcased by lotus flowers with Buddhist motif carved at one door of the church, while also wooden trusses which are shaped at the edge like a crocodile can be traced back to pre-Hispanic folk beliefs. The overall look of the facade leaves a vertical motion which is accentuated by the flanking of the two bell towers. A rare feature which the Minalin Church is comprised of is that the four capillas posas* in the low stone atrium which encloses the church grounds. It is the only church to still have this element intact which is also a common feature in Latin America . The interiors of the church feature a refurbished ceiling which covers the original composition and is done with wooden panels throughout; the nave walls keep intact the red bricks seen outside the church. The Minalin Church has one of the most beautiful retablos situated behind the altar with its grand White and Gold finish - eleven antique statues are placed in each niche. The statues play complement to the highlight and is of high value which is the 18th-century Our Lady of Consolation painting at the apex of the main altar. Another interesting feature is the bas relief of the Pierced Heart of Sta. Monica which symbolises suffering because of St. Augustine’s life of sin before turning his life around.

The church stands on a hill at the end of Plaza Calderon, and is one of only two churches in downtown Manila spared by the destruction brought about by the Second World War. It was the first church established by the Franciscans outside the protected walls of Intramuros which makes this even more of a gem than it already is - together with other beautiful churches in the capital of Manila, this church reminds fellow Filipinos alike to touch on their spiritual side despite the fast life of a growing cosmopolitan city. The adobe facade leaves an illusion of massiveness following a Baroque architectural style as it sits atop - overlooking the street. The floor-plan of the church resembles the shape of the Latin Cross - one of the churches in the country; just like the Tayabas Basilica which resembles the shape of a key; that follow a certain symbol or object. The facade is divided in three-levels with the top pediment done in Vitruvian-style scroll pattern; the second-level is composed of semicircular arched windows done in stain glass; while the lower-most level features the main entranced flanked by niches with statues of saints. Detailed ornamentations are found on niches and moldings in the cornices and apertures of the exterior of the church. A Spanish-era church will not be complete without the attached belfry, the Santa Ana Church features a four-level octagonal bell tower also comprised of adobe blocks with heavy string courses and matching ornamentations with the church’s facade. The massive interiors leads the eye directly to the heavily detailed and ornamented retablo highlighted by thirteen niches. The gold-leafed detailed main altar is done in cherrygueresque-style, which refers to the style of elaborate sculptural ornaments -expressive and florid decorative detailing which originated in Spain back in the 17thcentury. The thirteen niches are framed by solomic columns which is characterized by corkscrew-like spiral design - of course, with the Our Lady of the Abandoned as the main attraction. Contrasting the grandeur of the main altar, the dome of the Santa Ana Church which is situated just above the transept crossing features paintings of the twelve apostles and the evangelists, with the balconies overlooking the faithfuls. Aside from the abundant value the church structure itself possesses, the Camarin de la Virgen which is a chapel devoted to Our Lady of the Abandoned features heavily detailed paintings which were very-much preserved and retained from the time it was created. Another unique element is the Pozo de la Virgen which is said to contain healing waters and also enshrines an 18th-century wood and ivory relieve image of Our Lady of the Abandoned. The church was declared as a National Cultural Treasure in 1973. Today, the church stands humbly and quietly at the heart of Metro Manila.', fact_title: '', artistic_value: 9, photo_number: 12)

This church may be the simplest of them all but is definitely a marvel to have it on Philippine soil - it’s quite amazing to think that this church still stands even with the advent of modern times. The church is one of the most difficult to visit in mainland Luzon but seeing that the structure of the church hasn’t been much altered from the time it was built in the 17th century, the trip up is worth every kilometer. Experiencing this church up close takes you to a trip back in time, as if the church has a connection back when the construction was made possible by a local chieftain. The church is one of the few left standing that features rubble stone construction with decorations applied only to the facade - the solid squatness of the ensemble brought out by its high windows and a simply pediment just below it, suggests a fortress-like appearance. It is also unique among Spanish-era churches around the province of the Cagayan Valley because of itssize and novel design. The firm facade is covered with vines and moss due to the test of time, weather and everything that comes in between - exuding an earthly feeling. The three-level bell tower stands on the left, featuring a conical roof and finials protruding out of the corners of each level. The main doorway is flanked by niches for saints, while the upper level features a relief cross serving as ornamentation as the centrepiece of the entire facade. The detailed exterior contrasts the simple interior of the church which greets the entrance with white wood panels supporting the roof, and an altar capped by four retablos with statues of Jesus Christ, Mother Mary, and select saints. Outside the windows along the nave, rubble and ruins of what used to be the convent are seen; though permanently damaged by typhoons, it now transcends a unique feeling of budding curiosity. The St. Raymond Peñaflor Church was declared a National Cultural Treasure in 2001.', fact_title: '', artistic_value: 5, photo_number: 6)

The church played a vital role during the Filipino revolutionaries during the Spanish colonial period and also served as a garrison by the Japanese in World War II. The beauty of the church goes way beyond the fact that it has stood in witness of history; including the fact that it is the longest Spanish colonial church in the entire country. It is also considered the bestpreserved and most beautifully-decorated church complex in the entire province. Despite being damaged by earthquakes just like other churches, the Tayabas Basilica was able to preserve is grand and innate beauty. The facade features a blend of various styles despite the architectural style being Baroque, and this is a result of the many renovations the church has undergone. In line with the variety of artistic and design styles, the main entrance is flanked niches done in Mudejar style. Lion statues greet parishioners and visitors at the front of the church - which derives from Chinese influence during the pre-colonial times, when the Chinese traded with the natives. The facade is connected to a three-story level belfry which contains an eighteenth-century clock which is known to be the the oldest not only in the country but also in Asia, as well as the only one of its kind in the Philippines. A unique and well-preserved Franciscan Seal which was the symbol of the frays who lead the parish during the hispanic era - this was a symbol of the unity of Christ and St. Francis of Assisi which can found on the wall of the church facing the Alitao River. Upon entering the church, there is a greeting of Neo-Classical design together with a seven altars throughout the church. The beautifully done round transept and crossing was the work of “maestro carpintero” Severo Carpintero. The colorful and attractive dome features a balcony overlooking the altar. A nice note to take is in 2011, the lighting of the church’s facade was converted to solar energy - making it the first Spanish-colonial church to use such technology. Just like the country’s other heritage churches, the Tayabas Basilica is not only a testament to Spanishcolonial era architecture but also to the long and rich history of the struggle and rise of the Filipino people. No matter what religion or nationality you may be, the Tayabas Basilica is definitely up there with one of the best in the country - it’s own unique beauty and charm makes it a wonderful spot to pay a visit while in the province of Quezon.', fact_title: '', artistic_value: 11, photo_number:6 )

Standing still and tall in one of the hottest parts of the country, the Tuguegarao Cathedral is the largest church in the region, and does not only serve as the seat of the Archdiocese of Tuguegarao but also features great artistic and historic value. Built in 1758, it took seven years to build this proud brick church - it is considered one of the most beautiful in the country, though that may be debatable, the church has a picture featured in the Rome Basilica. From the outside, the church already gives a feeling of resplendence and splendidness as its three-level facade features a pair of White  superpositioned columns which brings a contrast to the brick facade; a semicircular arched entrance is flanked by multi-level niches; topped by the staple pediment and a centrally located round rose window. Architecture and historical aficionados highlight the church’s broken and crested pediment which is usual and typical especially to Cagayan churches. Situated at the side of the facade is the stunning and impressive five-storey bell tower, which overlooks and towers to give an admirable and unique 360-degree view of the city of Tuguegarao and the Cagayan Valley. The church is comprised of detailed architectural and artistic elements with finials, molded bricks with Marian and Dominican symbols, and Solomonic design. The interior is just as majestic with the newly renovated ceiling done in the reverted colourful trompe l’oeil style which produces a three-dimensional effect - as it guides and leads the faithful towards the massive gold-plated main altar. Despite being heavily damaged during WWII, the Tayabas Cathedral barely shows any of its scars, as it stands in its own unique and still grandeur amidst the hustle and bustle of Tuguegarao City.', fact_title: '', artistic_value: 11, photo_number:5 )

It stands still in the sleepy and slow town of Tumauini It gives a unique sense of beauty brought out by the contrasting colors in which the redbricked facade and the white cake-like belfry - presents the perfect infusion. Just like any other historical church, the Tumauini Church has withstood the tests of history, and damaged during WWII; but through the faithful parishioners, the church was repaired into original form. The beauty of the church also lies in the intricate details featured on the ornamented bricks both at the exterior and interior of the church. The church is known for its extensive use of different types of red clay bricks as well as its unique and delicate wall finishing and ornamentation. Taking a closer look at the bricks, the church features details of carvings of saints, cherubs, flowers, and foliage. The unique cylindrical belfry of the church is the only one of its kind in the country. The white belfry is as detailed as the facade with ornamental designs of its own - concentric circles with spiral curves on the finials crowning wavy silhouette of the facade - the cylindrical finish, features a bit of Chinese influence. Upon entering, the church greets parishioners and visitors alike with a brick finish throughout the interior. It does not have a retablo, instead features a simple altar under an ornate dome and the Crucified Lord against the brick wall - though the brick composition throughout adds a rare feel and ambiance to the altar. The interior is one-of-a-kind, and proves that the Tumauini Church is definitely well-preserved - and to no surprise, has been on the shortlist of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 2006. The province of Isabela will not be the same without the iconic Tumauini Church. ', fact_title: '', artistic_value: 10, photo_number:7 )
